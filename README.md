# js-edi-cite-client

Simple JavaScript client for The Environmental Data Initiative's [Cite
service](https://github.com/PASTAplus/cite).

[Live demo](https://ble-lter.github.io/js-edi-cite-client/demo.html)

This project includes a demo Web page with JavaScript code for consuming EDI's
[Cite service](https://github.com/PASTAplus/cite). The demo page only shows a
portion of what the service can do.  For documentation on all of the service's
capabilities, see the [Cite service project
page](https://github.com/PASTAplus/cite).

The [demo page](https://ble-lter.github.io/js-edi-cite-client/demo.html)
demonstrates the following:

* Building a URL for retrieving citation information with code
* Parsing the JSON response from a citation request into HTML
* Making asynchronous calls to the service for several package IDs
